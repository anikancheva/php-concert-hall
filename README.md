Web application for purchasing events tickets.
A user can register/login in order to buy a ticket and they can also view tickets they had already purchased.
The database has two initial users registered to demonstrate the functionality. 
Login credentials: -admin-> test_admin@gmail.com pass: 123; -user-> test_user@gmail.com pass:123; 
The admin can add/delete events and all users (admins and regular) can edit their personal information. 

To set up the project: (1) change the username and password for db access in "pdo_ini" file, (2) execute the sql script ("create_db") for the initial db data.
